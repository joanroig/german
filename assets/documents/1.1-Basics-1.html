  <h3 class="_1-7tO">Welcome to German :)</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Welcome to the German course! We will provide you with tips and notes throughout the course. However, be aware
      that these are optional. Only read them when you feel stuck, or when you are interested in the details. You can
      use the course without them.</p>
    <p>Often, it's best to just <strong>dive into the practice</strong>. See how it goes! You can always revisit the
      Notes section later on.</p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="_1-7tO">Capitalizing nouns</h3>
  <div>
    <p>In German, <strong>all nouns are capitalized</strong>. For example, "my name" is <em>mein
        <strong>N</strong>ame</em>, and "the apple" is <em>der <strong>A</strong>pfel</em>. This helps you identify
      which words are the nouns in a sentence.</p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="_1-7tO">German genders are strange</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Nouns in German are either <strong>feminine, masculine or neuter</strong>. For example, <em>Frau</em> (woman) is
      feminine, <em>Mann</em> (man) is masculine, and <em>Kind</em> (child) is neuter.</p>
    <p>While some nouns (Frau, Mann, …) have <strong>natural gender</strong> like in English (a woman is female, a man
      is male), <strong>most nouns have grammatical gender</strong> (depends on word ending, or seemingly random).</p>
    <p>For example, <em>Mädchen</em> (girl) is neuter, because all words ending in <em>-chen</em> are neuter.
      <em>Wasser</em> (water) is neuter, but <em>Cola</em> is feminine, and <em>Saft</em> (juice) is masculine.</p>
    <p>It is important to <strong>learn every noun along with its gender</strong> because parts of German sentences
      change depending on the gender of their nouns.</p>
    <p>For now, just remember that the <strong>indefinite article</strong> (a/an) <em>ein</em> is used for masculine and
      neuter nouns, and <em>eine</em> is used for feminine nouns. Stay with us to find out how "cases" will later modify
      these.</p>

  <h3 class="_1-7tO">Verb conjugations</h3>
  <div>
    <h4>Conjugating regular verbs</h4>
    <p><strong>Verb conjugation</strong> in German is more complex than in English. To conjugate a regular verb in the
      present tense, identify the stem of the verb and <strong>add the ending</strong> corresponding to any of the
      grammatical persons, which you can simply memorize. For now, here are the singular forms:</p>
    <p>Example: <em>trinken</em> (to drink)</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>English person</th>
          <th>ending</th>
          <th>German example</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>I</td>
          <td>-e</td>
          <td>ich trink<strong>e</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>you (singular informal)</td>
          <td>-st</td>
          <td>du trink<strong>st</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>he/she/it</td>
          <td>-t</td>
          <td>er/sie/es trink<strong>t</strong></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h4>Conjugations of the verb <em>sein</em> (to be)</h4>
    <p>Like in English, <em>sein</em> (to be) is completely irregular, and its conjugations simply need to be memorized.
      Again, you will learn the plural forms soon.</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>English</th>
          <th>German</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>I am</td>
          <td>ich <strong>bin</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>you (singular informal) are</td>
          <td>du <strong>bist</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>he/she/it is</td>
          <td>er/sie/es <strong>ist</strong></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
  <h3 class="_1-7tO">Umlauts</h3>
  <div>
    <p><strong>Umlauts</strong> are letters (more specifically vowels) that have two dots above them and appear in some
      German words like <em>Mädchen</em>.</p>
    <p><em>Literally, "Umlaut" means "around the sound," because its function is to change how the vowel sounds.</em>
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>no umlaut</th>
          <th>umlaut</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>a</td>
          <td>ä</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>o</td>
          <td>ö</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>u</td>
          <td>ü</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>An umlaut change may change the meaning. That's why it's important not to ignore those little dots.</p>
    <p>If you can't type these, a workaround is to type "oe" instead of "ö", for example.</p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="_1-7tO">No continuous aspect</h3>
  <div>
    <p>In German, there's <strong>no continuous aspect</strong>. There are no separate forms for "I drink" and "I am
      drinking". There's only one form: <em>Ich trinke.</em> </p>
    <p>There's no such thing as <em>Ich bin trinke</em> or <em>Ich bin trinken!</em></p>
    <p><em>When translating into English, how can I tell whether to use the simple (I drink) or the continuous form (I
        am drinking)?</em></p>
    <p>Unless the context suggests otherwise, either form should be accepted.</p>
  </div>
