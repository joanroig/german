<h3 class="_1-7tO">Common phrases</h3><div>
<p>Commonly used phrases are often <em>shortened versions of a longer sentence</em>. Or they might be <em>leftovers from some old grammar</em> that has otherwise fallen out of use. That means that their grammar might appear strange.</p>
<p>For now, just learn them like you would learn a long word.</p>
<h4><em>Wie geht's?</em></h4>
<p>There are many ways to ask someone how they are doing. Take "How are you?," "How do you do?" and "How is it going?" as examples. In German, the common phrase or idiom uses the verb <em>gehen</em> (go): <em>Wie geht es dir?</em> (How are you?).</p>
<p>This can be shortened to <em>Wie geht's?</em>.</p>
<h4><em>Willkommen</em> can be a false friend</h4>
<p>In German, <em>Willkommen</em> means welcome as in "Welcome to our home", but it does not mean welcome as in "Thank you - You're welcome". The German for the latter is <em>Gern geschehen</em> (or just <em>Gern!</em>) or <em>Keine Ursache</em>.</p>
<h4><em>Entschuldigung!</em></h4>
<p>Sometimes, German words can be a mouthful. Later on, you will find that you can take long words apart, and recognize the meaning from their elements.</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<td>ent-</td>
<td>de-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Schuld</td>
<td>guilt</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-ig</td>
<td>-y</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-gung</td>
<td>noun suffix</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So, <em>Entschuldigung</em> literally means something like "deguiltification": "Take the guilt away from me" :)</p>
