<div class="_3Fb9m"><h3 class="_1-7tO">Recognizing noun gender</h3><div>
<p>While noun genders might seem random for many words, there are quite a few ways to at least land a likely hit.</p>
<p>For example, many German nouns have some kind of ending, which will always or often come with a particular gender.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-living objects that end in <em>-e</em></strong>: these will almost always be <strong>feminine</strong> (<em>Schokolade, Erdbeere, Orange, Banane, Suppe,  …</em>). One of the very few exceptions is <em>der Käse</em>. This also works for many, but not all animals (<em>die Katze, Ente, Spinne, Biene, Fliege, …</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nouns <strong>beginning with <em>Ge-</em></strong> are often <strong>neuter</strong>. This is the only prefix determining gender. (<em>das Gemüse, …</em>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more endings like these. You will learn more about them throughout this course.</p>
</div><h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Fressen</em> vs. <em>essen</em></h3><div>
<p>Unlike English, German has two similar but different verbs for "to eat": <em>essen</em> and <em>fressen</em>. The latter is the standard way of expressing that an animal is eating something. Be careful <strong>not</strong> to use <em>fressen</em> to refer to humans – this would be a serious insult. Assuming you care about politeness, we will not accept your solutions if you use <em>fressen</em> with human subjects.</p>
<p>The most common way to express that a human being is eating something is the verb <em>essen</em>. It is not wrong to use it for animals as well, so we will accept both solutions.  But we strongly recommend you accustom yourself to the distinction between <em>essen</em> and <em>fressen</em>. </p>
<p>Fortunately, both verbs have the same conjugation:</p>
