<div class="_3Fb9m">
  <h4 class="_1-7tO"><em>Kleider</em> - dresses or clothes?</h4>
  <div>
    <p><em>Das Kleid</em> means "the dress", and <em>die Kleider</em> means "the dresses", but the plural <em>die
        Kleider</em> can also mean "clothes" or "clothing". In most cases, "clothing" (or "clothes") translates to
      <em>Kleidung</em> (usually uncountable), but it's important to be aware that <em>Kleider</em> can be used in that
      sense as well.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="_1-7tO"><em>Hose</em> or <em>Hosen</em>?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Both <em>Hose</em> and <em>Hosen</em> translate to "pants" ("trousers" in British English), but they're not
      interchangeable. The singular <em>Hose</em> refers to one pair of pants, and the plural <em>Hosen</em> refers to
      multiple pairs of pants.</p>
