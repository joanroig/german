  <h3 class="_1-7tO">Combining stuff</h3>
  <div>
    <p>German is well known for its long words that can be made up on the go by concatenating existing words. In this
      skill you will learn one very simple and commonly used way of forming compounds: adding <em>-zeug</em> (="stuff")
      to existing words.</p>
    <p>Remember that the last element determines gender and plural. So all new words in this lesson will be neuter.</p>
    <p>OK, because you asked: the longest "real" German word (so far) is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rindfleisch-etikettierungs-überwachungs-aufgaben-übertragungs-gesetz</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(Without the hyphens. We had to add those in order to be able to show the whole word…)</p>
    <p>It's a law on how to transfer tasks about the monitoring of the labeling of beef. At least that's what the word
      says.</p>

    <p>No, words like this don't normally happen in German :)</p>

  <h3 class="_1-7tO">How much stuff?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>In English, you can't count "stuff" -- you can't use the plural "stuffs" or say that "there are three stuffs on
      the floor". Instead, "stuff" is a collective noun, referring to a group of things but used in the singular: "there
      is stuff on the floor".</p>
    <p>Some German <em>-zeug</em> words can work like this as well -- for example, <em>Spielzeug</em> and
      <em>Werkzeug</em> in the singular, without an article, mean "toys" and "tools", which are plural in English.</p>
    <p>Those words can also be used in a countable way: <em>ein Spielzeug, zwei Werkzeuge</em> "one toy, two tools". So
      "the tools" could be either <em>das Werkzeug</em> or <em>die Werkzeuge</em> -- the former would view the tools as
      a group, the latter would consider them individually.</p>
    <p>Look out for whether there is an indefinite article or number before the singular word to see whether it's used
      countably or uncountably.</p>
    <p>If there's a possessive word or a definite article before such a noun in the singular, it could be either:
      <em>mein Werkzeug ist neu</em> could mean either "My tool is new" or "My tools are new", for example; similarly
      with <em>das Werkzeug ist neu</em> which could be either "The tool is new" or "The tools are new".</p>
    <p>(An English word that works similarly is "fruit" -- "my fruit" could refer to just one apple, or it could refer
      to two apples and a banana all together, depending on whether "fruit" is used countably or uncountably.)</p>
    <p>Other <em>-zeug</em> words are always regular countable words, such as <em>Flugzeug</em> "airplane" or
      <em>Feuerzeug</em> "lighter".</p>
