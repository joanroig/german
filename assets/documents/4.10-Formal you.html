    <p>Surprise! There's another way of addressing people. The good news is: it's super easy. Just use the "they" forms
      when talking to people you're not close with.</p>
    <p>Need more details? Then read on :)</p>

  <h3 class="_1-7tO">German You: Who are you talking to?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>In English, "you" can be either singular or plural, and no distinction is made between formal and informal.
      In German, there are <strong>three ways of saying "you"</strong>.</p>
    <h4><em>Du</em></h4>
    <p>If you are <strong><em>familiar</em> with someone, you use <em>du</em></strong> (which is called "duzen"). For
      example, if you talk to your mother, you would say:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Hast <em>du</em> jetzt Zeit, Mama?" (Do you have time now, Mommy?).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use this form for family members, co-students, children and young adults.</p>
    <h4><em>Ihr</em></h4>
    <p>If you <strong>refer to more than one person, you use <em>ihr</em></strong>. This is also a "familiar" form, so
      use it in the same settings as <em>du</em>.</p>
    <p>The German <em>ihr</em> you learned earlier is the <strong>informal plural</strong> of "you," like in</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hans und Karl, habt ihr Zeit? (Hans and Karl, do you have time?)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><em>Sie</em> (formal you)</h4>
    <p>If you are <strong>not familiar</strong> with someone or still wish to stay <strong>formal and express
        respect</strong>, you use <em>Sie</em> (so-called "siezen"). For example, you would always address your
      professor like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Haben <em>Sie</em> jetzt Zeit, Herr Schmidt? (Do you have time now, Mr. Schmidt?)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Sie</em> is also used for multiple people. But you can't translate it well with "you all" or "you guys",
      because that would sound too informal.</p>
    <p>Here are the three forms of "you", and "they" for comparison:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>English person</th>
          <th>ending</th>
          <th>German example</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>you (singular informal)</td>
          <td>-st</td>
          <td>du trink<strong><em>st</em></strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>you (plural informal)</td>
          <td>-t</td>
          <td>ihr trink<strong><em>t</em></strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>you (formal)</td>
          <td>-en</td>
          <td>Sie trink<strong><em>en</em></strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>they</td>
          <td>-en</td>
          <td>sie trink<strong><em>en</em></strong></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>When spoken, <strong>"they" and formal "you" are identical</strong>. So, in a way, Germans formally address
      people like "How are they today?"</p>
    <h4>How do you know if <em>sie</em> means "she", "they", or "you"?</h4>
    <p>You can distinguish the formal <em>Sie</em> from the plural <em>sie</em> (they) because the <strong>formal
        <em>Sie</em> will always be capitalized</strong>. However, it will remain ambiguous at the beginning of written
      sentences.</p>
    <p>For instance, <em>Sie sind schön.</em> can either refer to a beautiful individual or a group of beautiful people.
      The verbs for <em>sie</em> (they) and <em>Sie</em> (you) are conjugated the same. On Duolingo, either should be
      accepted unless the context suggests otherwise. In real life, there's always context. Don't worry about
      misunderstandings.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, the <strong>verb for <em>sie</em> (she) is different</strong>. <em>Sie ist schön.</em> only
      translates to "She is beautiful." There's no ambiguity.</p>
    <h4>Other formal "you"s</h4>
    <p>There are more ways to address people formally in German, but they are not in common use and/or outdated, so we
      don't support them in this course. You might encounter them in Middle Ages reenactments or so :)</p>
    <p>The <em>third person singular</em> was used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hat <em>er</em> heute gut geschlafen? (literally, "Has <em>he</em> slept well today?")</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <em>second person plural</em> was also used, and is still used locally:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Ihr</em> habt einen schönen Hut. (literally, "<em>You all</em> have a nice hat.")</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>You will encounter the informal you in this skill as well</h4>
    <p>As some of the sentences in this skill are shared among multiple skills, you will encounter the informal you in
      this skill as well. For technical reasons, this cannot be changed at this point. Please do not send a report
      regarding this issue.</p>
