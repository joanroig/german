  <h4 class="_1-7tO"><em>Plastik</em></h4>
  <div>
    <p><em>Plastik</em> is one of the few words that changes meaning, depending on which gender it is.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>das Plastik (artificial material, normally from petroleum)</li>
      <li>die Plastik (a word for "sculpture")</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h4 class="_1-7tO"><em>Holz, Wald, Forst</em></h4>
  <div>
    <p>In English, "wood" can refer to a material, and to a forest.</p>
    <p>In German, <em>Holz</em> only refers to the material. <em>Der Wald</em> is "the forest". We also have a word
      <em>der Forst</em>, but it only refers to a maintained forest (something like a garden for trees), where the trees
      are grown for commercial purposes.</p>
