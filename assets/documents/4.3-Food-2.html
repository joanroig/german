    <h4><em>Küche</em> vs. <em>Kuchen</em></h4>
    <p><em>Die Küche</em> (the kitchen) and <em>der Kuchen</em> (the cake) are often confused by learners. To German
      ears, they sound quite different. One reason is that in <em>Küche</em>, the vowel is short, while the vowel in
      <em>Kuchen</em> is long.</p>

    <p><em>Kochen</em> (to cook) also has a short vowel.</p>
    <h4><em>Schmecken</em></h4>
    <p><em>Schmecken</em> is very similar to the English word "to taste":</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ich schmecke Knoblauch! (I taste garlic!)</li>
      <li>Knoblauch schmeckt super! (Garlic tastes great!)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, <em>schmecken</em> can be used by itself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Die Pizza schmeckt nicht! (The pizza does not taste <em>good</em>!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><em>Müsli</em></h4>
    <p><em>Müsli</em> originally refers to "Bircher Müesli", a Swiss breakfast dish, based on rolled oats and fresh or
      dried fruits.</p>
    <p>Nowadays, people will use it for all kinds of cereals or granola, often with high sugar content.</p>
    <h4><em>Hähnchen</em></h4>
    <p><em>Hähnchen</em> usually refers to a chicken that has been turned into a dish. While derived from the word for
      "male chicken" (<em>der Hahn</em>), the only distinction today is that it is a food item.</p>
    <p>Remember that words ending in <em>-chen</em> are always neuter: <em>das Hähnchen</em>.</p>
    <h4><em>Salat</em></h4>
    <p><em>Salat</em> can refer to the dish, as well as to the green leaves (usually lettuce) that often go into it.</p>
