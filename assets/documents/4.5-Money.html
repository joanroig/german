  <h4 class="_1-7tO"><em>Euro</em> or <em>Euros</em>?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>In German, the singular is <em>Euro</em> and the <strong>plural is usually <em>Euro</em></strong> as well. As a
      rule of thumb, use <em>Euro</em> when talking about a specific amount, e.g. <em>200 Euro</em>. </p>
    <p>In some contexts, the form <em>Euros</em> is used as well. For instance, you can say <em>Euros</em> to refer to
      individual euro coins, an unquantified amount of euros, or euros as opposed to a different currency, e.g.:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ich habe hundert Schweizer Franken, aber keine <em>Euros</em> (I have a hundred Swiss francs but no euros).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many native speakers use either plural form regardless of context.</p>
    <p>In English, either plural form is perfectly fine. The plural form <em>euro</em> tends to be preferred in the
      Republic of Ireland, and the plural form <em>euros</em> tends to preferred pretty much anywhere else. Originally,
      the plural form <em>euro</em> was supposed to be used in official EU documents, but that's no longer the case.</p>
