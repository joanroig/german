  <h4 class="_1-7tO">Personal Pronouns in the Dative Case</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Many words change in the dative case. For the third person pronouns, the following are different from the
      nominative case: the masculine pronoun is <em>ihm</em> (to him), the feminine is <em>ihr</em> (to her), the neuter
      is <em>ihm</em> (to it), and the plural is <em>ihnen</em> (to them).</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Nominative</th>
          <th>Accusative</th>
          <th>Dative</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>ich (I)</td>
          <td>mich (me)</td>
          <td><strong>mir</strong> (to me)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>du</td>
          <td>dich</td>
          <td><strong>dir</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>er / es / sie</td>
          <td>ihn / es / sie</td>
          <td><strong>ihm / ihm / ihr</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>wir</td>
          <td>uns</td>
          <td><strong>uns</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ihr</td>
          <td>euch</td>
          <td><strong>euch</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>sie</td>
          <td>sie</td>
          <td><strong>ihnen</strong></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Some observations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In dative, <em>mir, dir, ihr</em> (to me / you / her) rhyme.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the <strong>third person</strong>, the <strong>endings are the same as for the articles</strong>: <em>-m,
            -r, -n</em>. However, plural dative is "ihn<strong>en</strong>" (not <em>ihn</em>, as you might expect).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the second person plural, accusative and dative pronouns are the same.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now you can understand why, when thanking a female person, it is only correct to say <em>Ich danke ihr</em> ("I
      thank her", literally "I give-thank to her") and not <em>Ich danke sie</em> (that sounds like "I thank she" would
      sound to an English speaker).</p>

  <h4 class="_1-7tO">Dative verbs</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Remember that some verbs have a dative object. This is just a quirk of German. There was a reason for it when
      these words were created, but it's not easy to understand anymore, after a lot of language change.</p>
    <p>In short, you just have to learn these :) There aren't very many.</p>
    <p><em>Gehören</em> literally means to "belong to". But don't translate too literally, often a different translation
      will be more natural.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wem gehört das Kleid? ("Whose dress is it?" - Literally, "Whom does the dress belong to?")</li>
    </ul>
