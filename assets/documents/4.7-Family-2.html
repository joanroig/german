  <h4 class="_1-7tO">Tall and short people</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Tall people are <em>groß</em>, not <em>hoch</em>, and short people are <em>klein</em>, not <em>kurz</em>.</p>
    <p>This is why German people will often refer to tall people as "big" :)</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="_1-7tO"><em>Cousin, Cousine</em></h4>
  <div>
    <p>These are French words. While it is possible to write <em>Cousine</em> as <em>Kusine</em> now, German never found
      a way to actually spell <em>Cousin</em> differently. This is because German originally does not have the French
      sound at the end. Some people pronounce it like "Kusäng" instead.</p>

  <h4 class="_1-7tO"><em>Die Frau kennt seinen Onkel</em> - Why not <em>ihren Onkel?</em></h4>
  <div>
    <p>Both <em>Die Frau kennt ihren Onkel</em> and <em>Die Frau kennt seinen Onkel</em> are grammatically correct, but
      they don't have the same meaning.</p>
    <p>When you say <em>Die Frau kennt ihren Onkel</em>, you're either talking about the woman's own uncle, another
      female person's uncle, or the uncle of multiple people.</p>
    <p>When you say <em>Die Frau kennt seinen Onkel</em>, you're talking about another person's uncle, and that person
      is male. People can know other people's relatives.</p>
