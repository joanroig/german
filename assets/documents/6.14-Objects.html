  <h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Hose, Schere, Brille</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p>Pants used to be two hoses, until somebody had the idea of stitching them together. Glasses are now joined into
      one object. If you deconstruct scissors into multiple objects, you have two awkward knives and a screw.</p>
    <p><strong>German uses the singular for all of these</strong>. <em>Die Hose</em> is "a pair of pants". <em>Die
        Hosen</em> (plural) is at least two pairs of pants.</p>

  <h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Stelle</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p><em>Die Stelle</em> has the meaning of "position" in at least two ways. It can be a location, or it can be a job
      position.</p>

  <h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Geschenk, Gift</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p>The common German word German for "gift" is <em>das Geschenk</em>. <strong><em>Das Gift</em> means
        "poison"</strong>. The reason is that a long time ago, "gift" in the meaning of "something that is given" was
      used as an euphemism for poison.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Why did he die?"</li>
      <li>"Kunigunde gave him something."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The original meaning survives in the word <em>die Mitgift</em> (dowry).</p>
