  <h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Der See</em> vs. <em>die See</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p><em>Der See</em> means "the lake". <em><strong>Die</strong> See</em> means "the sea, the ocean". It is less
      commonly used. German uses more often <em>das Meer</em> or <em>der Ozean</em> for the latter.</p>
    <p>Check out <em>Bodensee</em> and <em>Nordsee</em> on Google Maps and see if you can figure out which one is
      feminine and which one is masculine :)</p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Der Strand</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p><em>Der Strand</em> means "the beach". This meaning still survives in the English adjective "stranded"
      (literally, ended up on a lonely beach).</p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Holz, Wald, Forst</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p>In English, "wood" can refer to a material, and to a forest.</p>
    <p>In German, <em>Holz</em> only refers to the material. <em>Der Wald</em> is "the forest". We also have a word
      <em>Der Forst</em>, but it only refers to a maintained forest (something like a garden for trees), where the trees
      are grown for commercial purposes.</p>
