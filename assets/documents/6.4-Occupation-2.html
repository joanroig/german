  <h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Student</em> or <em>Schüler</em>?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>A <em>Student</em> is a university student and a <em>Schüler</em> is a pupil/student at a primary, secondary or
      high school. Students attending other types of schools such as language or dancing schools may also be called
      <em>Schüler</em>.</p>

  <h3 class="_1-7tO">Dropping articles</h3>
  <div>
    <p>When talking about your or someone else's profession in sentences such as <em>I'm a teacher</em> or <em>She's a
        judge</em>, German speakers <strong>usually drop the indefinite article</strong> <em>(ein/eine)</em>. It sounds
      more natural to say <em>Ich bin Lehrer</em> and <em>Sie ist Richterin</em> than <em>Ich bin ein Lehrer</em> and
      <em>Sie ist eine Richterin</em>. This rule also applies to students. </p>
    <p>If you add an adjective, you can't drop the article. <em>Er ist ein schlechter Arzt</em> (He's a bad doctor) is
      correct, but <em>Er ist schlechter Arzt</em> is not. </p>
    <p>Also note that <strong>you can't drop the definite article</strong> <em>(der/die/das)</em>.</p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="_1-7tO">Male and female variants</h3>
  <div>
    <p>The grammatical gender usually matches the biological sex of the person you're referring to, i.e. the word that
      refers to a male baker is grammatically masculine, and the word that refers to a female baker is grammatically
      feminine. In the vast majority of cases, <strong>the female variant is formed by simply adding the suffix
        <em>-in</em> to the male variant</strong>, e.g. <em>der Bäcker</em> becomes <em>die Bäckerin</em> and <em>der
        Schüler</em> (the pupil) becomes <em>die Schülerin</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>The plural<em><em> of the female variant </em></em>is formed by adding the suffix
        <em>-innen</em></strong> to the singular of the male variant, e.g. <em>die Bäcker<strong>innen</strong></em> and
      <em>die Schüler<strong>innen</strong></em>.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that, in some cases, the plural comes with an umlauted stem vowel. This applies to the female
      variant as well, e.g. <em>der K<strong>o</strong>ch</em> becomes <em>die K<strong>ö</strong>che</em> and <em>die
        K<strong>ö</strong>chin</em> becomes <em>die K<strong>ö</strong>chinnen</em>.</p>
