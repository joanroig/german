  <h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Student</em> or <em>Schüler?</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p>A <em>Student</em> is a university student and a <em>Schüler</em> is a pupil/student at a primary, secondary or
      high school. Students attending other types of schools such as language or dancing schools may also be called
      <em>Schüler</em>.</p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="_1-7tO">A <em>Hochschule</em> is not a <em>high school</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p>Careful: a <em>Hochschule</em> is not a high school. Depending on the context, <em>Hochschule</em> is either an
      umbrella term that comprises <em>Universitäten</em> and <em>Fachhochschulen</em>, or it's a synonym for
      <em>Fachhochschule</em>.</p>
    <p>A <em>Universität</em> is a full research university and a <em>Fachhochschule</em> (often just called
      <em>Hochschule</em>) is a university with a practical focus that offers Bachelor and Master degrees. PhD
      programmes may be offered in cooperation with other universities.</p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="_1-7tO">A <em>Gymnasium</em> is not a <em>gym</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p>In German, the word <em>das Gymnasium</em> refers to a university prep-school.</p>
    <p>The German for a sports gym is <em>die Turnhalle</em> (used by schools and sports clubs) or <em>das
        Fitnessstudio</em> (commercial).</p>
