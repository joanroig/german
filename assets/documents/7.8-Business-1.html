  <div>
    <p>Don't confuse <em>die Fabrik</em> (the manufacturing plant) with the English word "fabric". The former is the
      place where something is fabricated, the latter is the fabricated product of the world's first manufacturing
      plants (hence the name).</p>
    <p>In addition, <em>die Fabrik</em> is stressed on the last syllable.</p>
