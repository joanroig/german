  <div>
    <p>In German, the words for "story" and "history" are the same (just as in Spanish).</p>
    <p>However, they are used differently. When used with an article, it generally refers to a story:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hast du <em>die Geschichte</em> gelesen? (Did you read the story?)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most of the time, when referring to history, there won't be an article:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ich habe <em>Geschichte</em> studiert. (I studied history at university.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, only "story" will have a plural version:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Er erz√§hlt lustige <em>Geschichten</em>. (He tells funny stories.)</li>
    </ul>
