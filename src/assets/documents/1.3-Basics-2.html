  <h3 class="_1-7tO">German plurals are also strange :)</h3>
  <div>
    <p>In English, making plurals out of singular nouns is typically as straightforward as adding <em>-(e)s</em> at the
      end of the word. In German, the transformation is more complex. You will learn details about this in a later
      lesson.</p>
    <p>In some languages (such as French or Spanish), genders are also differentiated in the plural. In German, the
      <strong>plural form does not depend on what gender</strong> the singular form is.</p>
    <p>Regardless of grammatical gender, <strong>all plural nouns take the definite article <em>die</em></strong> (You
      will later learn how "cases" can modify this). This <em>does not make them feminine</em>. The grammatical gender
      of a word never changes. Like many other words, <em>die</em> is simply used for multiple purposes.</p>
    <p>Just like in English, there's <strong>no plural indefinite</strong> article.</p>

  <h3 class="_1-7tO">You, you and you</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Most languages use different words to address one person, or several people.</p>
    <p>In German, when <strong>addressing a single person, use <em>du</em></strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Du</em> bist mein Kind. (<em>You</em> are my child.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are talking to <strong>more than one person, use <em>ihr</em></strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Ihr</em> seid meine Kinder. (<em>You</em> are my children.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some English speakers would use "y'all" or "you guys" for this plural form of "you".</p>
    <p>Note that these only work for people you are familiar with (friends, family, …). For others, you would use the
      formal "you", which we teach later in this course. So stay tuned :)</p>
  </div>
  <h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Ihr</em> vs. <em>er</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p>If you're new to German, <em>ihr</em> and <em>er</em> may sound confusingly similar, but there is actually a
      difference. <em>ihr</em> sounds similar to the English word "ear", and <em>er</em> sounds similar to the English
      word "air" (imagine a British/RP accent).</p>
    <p>Don't worry if you can't pick up on the difference at first. You may need some more listening practice before you
      can tell them apart. Also, try using headphones instead of speakers.</p>
    <p><strong>Learn the pronouns together with the verb endings</strong>. This will greatly reduce the amount of
      ambiguity.</p>

  <h3 class="_1-7tO">Verb conjugation</h3>
