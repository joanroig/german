  <h3 class="_1-7tO">Lakes and seas - false friends ahoy!</h3>
  <div>
    <p>The German for "the lake" is <em>der See</em> (masculine) and the most commonly used word for "the sea" is
      <em>das Meer</em> (neuter).</p>
    <p>There's another slightly less commonly used word for "the sea": <em>die See</em> (feminine).</p>
    <p>Be careful not to confuse <em>der See</em> (the lake) and <em>die See</em> (the sea). Remember that when you
      learn a noun, you should always learn the gender with it.</p>
