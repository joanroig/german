  <h4 class="_1-7tO">Informal and formal words for family members</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Just like in English, there are informal and formal words for "mother", "father", "grandmother", and
      "grandfather". Note that in German, the difference between formal and informal is a lot more pronounced than in
      English. The informal terms are pretty much only used within your own family.</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>formal</th>
          <th>informal</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>die Mutter (the mother)</td>
          <td>die Mama (the mom)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>der Vater (the father)</td>
          <td>der Papa (the dad)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>die Großmutter (the grandmother)</td>
          <td>die Oma (the grandma)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>der Großvater (the grandfather)</td>
          <td>der Opa (the grandpa)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>

  <h4 class="_1-7tO">Family plurals</h4>
  <div>
    <p>You might notice that most members of the close family have their own "system" of plurals:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>singular</th>
          <th>plural</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>die M<strong>u</strong>tter</td>
          <td>die M<strong>ü</strong>tter</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>der V<strong>a</strong>ter</td>
          <td>die V<strong>ä</strong>ter</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>der Br<strong>u</strong>der</td>
          <td>die Br<strong>ü</strong>der</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>die T<strong>o</strong>chter</td>
          <td>die T<strong>ö</strong>chter</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>die Schwester</td>
          <td>die Schwester<strong>n</strong></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p><em>Schwester</em> has an extra <em>-n</em>, because it can't change its vowel (<em>e</em> has no umlaut).</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="_1-7tO"><em>Eltern</em></h4>
  <div>
    <p><em>Eltern</em> (parents) has no singular, unlike in English. We normally refer to <em>Mutter</em> or
      <em>Vater</em> then.</p>
    <p>If necessary, there is a word <em>das Elternteil</em> (literally, "the parents part"). But this is only used in
      formal settings, for example on forms.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="_1-7tO">Alternative words for family members</h4>
  <div>
    <p>There are countless alternative words for certain family members. A lot of them are regionalisms or influenced by
      your own family's heritage. Some of them are ambiguous as well. For instance, some people call their father
      "papa", and some people call their grandfather "papa".</p>
    <p>We can't accept all these terms, and since translations used in the German course for English speakers may also
      pop up in the English course for German speakers, we don't want to confuse German speakers with these words.
      Please understand that we're not going to add more alternatives. In your own interest, stick to the ones suggested
      by Duolingo (see above).</p>
