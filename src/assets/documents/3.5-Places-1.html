  <h3 class="_1-7tO">Recognizing noun gender</h3>
  <div>
    <p>As mentioned before, you can often know the <strong>gender of a noun</strong> by <strong>looking at the word
        ending</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>non-living objects that end in <em>-e</em>: these will almost always be feminine (<em>die Lampe, Schokolade,
          Erdbeere, Orange, Banane, Suppe, Hose, Jacke, Sonne, Straße, Brücke, Schule, …</em>)</li>
      <li>nouns beginning with <em>Ge-</em> are often neuter. This is the only prefix determining gender. (<em>das
          Gebäude, Gemüse, Gesicht, Gesetz, …</em>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, rhyming can often help. If you already know a noun that rhymes with the new one, there's a good
      chance they will have the same gender. Go for it :)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>der Fisch, der Tisch</li>
      <li>der Raum, der Traum, der Baum</li>
      <li>der Kopf, der Knopf</li>
    </ul>

  <h3 class="_1-7tO">Pronunciation of French loanwords</h3>
  <div>
    <p>When English uses a word from French, it usually pronounces it according to English sound rules. German will
      often sound more close to the original.</p>
    <p>An example for this is <em>Restaurant</em>. Like in French, the last syllable will sound roughly like "raw". The
      <em>-t</em> will be silent. Some people will pronounce the ending similar to English "rung" instead. Of course,
      the <em>R-</em> will sound like the German <em>r</em>, not the English one.</p>
