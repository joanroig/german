  <h4 class="_1-7tO">German numbers</h4>
  <div>
    <p>You learned earlier that the numbers from 1-19 are very similar to those in English.</p>
    <p>This mostly continues in German, with one important quirk. Did you ever notice that the digits in numbers 13-19
      are kind of "switched" in English? German continues that through to 99.</p>
    <p>So <strong>84 would be <em>vier|und|acht|zig</em></strong> (literally, four and eighty).</p>
    <p>This might take some getting used to, but at least it's consistent ;)</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="_1-7tO">Hundert</h4>
  <div>
    <p>For "100", people would usually just say <em>hundert</em>, not <em>einhundert</em> (as in English).</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="_1-7tO">Huge numbers</h4>
  <div>
    <p>There used to be two different systems for huge numbers, called "short scale" and "long scale". Unfortunately,
      German and American English ended up with different ones. British English used to use the long scale, but switched
      to short scale.</p>
