  <h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Verein</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p><em>Der Verein</em> (the <em>r</em> is silent) is something between a club and a society. It is very common in
      Germany: There are almost 600,000 <em>eingetragene Vereine</em> (publicly registered associations) in Germany.
      They bear the abbreviation <em>e.V.</em>.</p>
    <p>A <em>Verein</em> might help the homeless, offer tennis lessons, dance together, among many other activities.</p>

  <h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Man</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p>In English, you can say "you can say" or "one can say". In German, <em>man</em> is commonly used for this
      purpose. It does not imply that only male people are included, think of it like the English "man" as in "mankind".
    </p>
    <p>Grammatically, it works exactly like <em>er</em>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Er</em> schl채ft nicht auf der K체che. (He does not sleep in the kitchen)</li>
      <li><em>Man</em> schl채ft nicht in der K체che! (One does not sleep in the kitchen!)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><em>Ein paar</em> vs. <em>ein Paar</em></h4>
    <p><em>Ein paar</em> (lowercase p) means <em>a few</em>, <em>some</em> or <em>a couple (of)</em> (only in the sense
      of <strong>at least two, not exactly two!</strong>).</p>
    <p><em>Ein Paar</em> (uppercase P) means <em>a pair (of)</em> and is only used for things that typically come in
      pairs of two, e.g. <em>ein Paar Schuhe</em> (a pair of shoes).</p>
    <p>So this is quite similar to English "a couple" (a pair) vs. "a couple of" (some).</p>
