  <h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Das Handtuch</em> (the towel) vs. <em>das Tuch</em> (the cloth)</h3>
  <div>
    <p>A <em>Handtuch</em> is a towel, not a hand towel. Of course, a towel can be a hand towel, but this does not mean
      that the two words are interchangeable. A pet can be a dog, but this does not mean that the words "pet" and "dog"
      are interchangeable.</p>
