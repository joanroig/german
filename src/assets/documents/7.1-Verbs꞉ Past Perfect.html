    <h4>How is the past perfect formed?</h4>
    <p>The past perfect is formed almost the same way as the Perfekt. The only difference is that the helper verb will
      be in the past tense:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ich <em>habe</em> gegessen. (I have eaten.)</li>
      <li>
        <p>Ich <em>hatte</em> gegessen. (I had eaten.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Ich <em>bin</em> geschwommen. (I have swum.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>Ich <em>war</em> geschwommen. (I had swum.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How to end up with the right participle?</h4>
