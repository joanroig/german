  <h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Affen</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p>In German, <em>der Affe</em> may refer to all primates, or to all primates excluding lemurs.</p>
    <p>In everyday English, "apes" tend to be distinguished from other primates, most of which are referred to as
      "monkeys". German does not make this distinction. If you want to refer to apes only, you can use the word
      <em>Menschenaffen</em>.</p>

  <h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Kamele</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p><em>Das Kamel</em> is stressed on the last syllable: [kaˈmeːl]. Unfortunately, Duolingo's computer voice has
      other ideas about this. When you're in Cologne, don't confuse these adorable, but weighty animals with
      <em>Kamelle</em> ([kaˈmɛlə], caramels traditionally thrown around during <em>Karneval</em>).</p>
