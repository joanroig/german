<div class="_3Fb9m">
  <h3 class="_1-7tO"><em>Wunderbar</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p>Due to its use as a loanword in English, <em>wunderbar</em> is often overused by English-speaking learners of
      German. Contrary to popular opinion, most Germans don't run around in leather trousers, smiling broadly and
      shouting <em>Wunderbar!</em> at each other :)</p>
    <p>Think of it as the equivalent to "splendid!". If you want to sound less antiquated, better use <em>Super!</em> or
      <em>Toll!</em> or something like that.</p>
