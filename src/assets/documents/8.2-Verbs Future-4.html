  <h3 class="_1-7tO">The power of <em>machen</em></h3>
  <div>
    <p><em>Machen</em> (to do) is a very versatile word. Often, when you don't know the word for an action, you can
      somehow use <em>machen</em> do describe it. Often, there is even an existing word combination:</p>
    <p>Here are some examples. The "higher-level" word is in brackets.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>auf</em>machen (öffnen) — to open</li>
      <li><em>zu</em>machen (schließen) — to close</li>
      <li><em>besser</em> machen (verbessern) — to improve</li>
      <li><em>weg</em>machen (entfernen) — to remove</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a fallback, it can help you to just continue speaking, even when you run the risk making up your own words:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ich muss den Brief noch <em>machen</em>. (very bad German, but people will get what you mean)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a <strong>general rule</strong>: It's better to speak bad German, than to stop speaking, just because you
      don't know how to say it well. Keep going, and learn from your mistakes.</p>
    <p>Fake it, till you make it :)</p>
